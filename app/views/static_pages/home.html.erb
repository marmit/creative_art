      "WHERE EVERYONE CAN LEARN TO DRAW"
    </h1>
    <h2 id="home_page">
      Here at <b id="company_name">Creative</b> Art and Drawing Studios we use a step by step approach to teach that drawing is a skill that anyone can learn, just as anyone can learn to read, write, or play an instrument.<br /><br />

      Each week a new project is chosen, and broken down into small elements, which are then put back together to create a student's very own work of art.<br /><br />

      <b id="company_name">Creative</b> Art and Drawing Studios is a fun environment where there are no judgments made on students' projects. Our teaching method gives enough instruction for success, but allows for individual creativity to shine.<br /><br />

      Classes are one hour long. A project is completed from start to finish each week within that one hour. All supplies are provided. There are no additional supply costs to the tuition.
